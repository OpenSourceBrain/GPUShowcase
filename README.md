GPU Based Neuronal Simulations
==============================

The main purpose of this OSB project is to compile a list of GPU based simulation initiatives, linking to downloadable code & publications. 

See here for more details: http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/gpushowcase/wiki/Wiki

The GitHub repository is intended for code snippets and examples which can be run on some of the featured platforms. There is already a [simple NeuroML2 network](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/GPUShowcase/tree/master/NeuroML2) which could serve as the basis for examples to run on different platforms.
